  <p>My name is Jenna Nytes.  I live in Richfield with my family.
  </p>

  <p> I currently work for M Health Fairview as a Data Analyst within the Quality and Patient Safety department.  Some of the main
    reporting that I do is related to inpatient mortality and patient safety indiciators.  I am also the resident subject matter expert 
    for a quality reporting tool called Vizient.
  </p>

  <p> In my free time I like cooking and baking as well as reading.  In the summer, I love going to my family's cabin on Lake Minnewaska
    in Starbuck, Minnesota where I enjoy boating on beautiful sunny days.
