      <p>My name is Jenna Nytes. I currently work for M Health Fairview as a Data Analyst within the Quality and Patient Safety department.  Some of the main
        reporting that I do is related to inpatient mortality and patient safety indiciators.  I am also the resident subject matter expert 
        for a quality reporting tool called Vizient.  </p>
        
        <p>In my free time I like cooking and baking as well as reading.  In the summer, I love going to my family's cabin on Lake Minnewaska
        in Starbuck, Minnesota where I enjoy boating on beautiful sunny days.</p>
