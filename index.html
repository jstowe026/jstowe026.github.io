  <p>My name is Jenna Nytes.  I currently live in Richfield with my husband, Dan, and son, Owen.
  </p>

  <p> I currently work for M Health Fairview as a Data Analyst within the Quality and Patient Safety department.  Some of the main
    reporting that I do is related to inpatient mortality and patient safety indiciators.  I am also the resident subject matter expert 
    for a quality reporting tool called Vizient.
